## About the repositroy
This repository does not contain any source code for the app. Instead, we work on issues, listen to your feedback and publish our development plan here.

## The Plan
Use [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) as a design template while providing key functionalities with native code:
- Version Control (Git clone, commits, diff editor and more) ✅
- Embeded terminal 🏃
- Built in Python runtime 🏃
- C/C++ Runtime with Emscripten (WebAssembly) 🏃
- Local web development environment (Node) 🏃
- [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol) support 🏃

## What we've achieved
- Monaco Editor integration
- Partial Support for Version Control (Git clone, commits, diff editor) (Push & pulls, authentication are not yet supported)
- Server-side multi-file compiling for 40+ languages
- Markdown file preview
- Built in web server
- Files App Integration
